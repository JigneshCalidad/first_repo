File Operations Tips:
1. Always use 'with' statement for file operations
2. Handle FileNotFoundError exceptions
3. Close files properly (with statement does this automatically)
4. Use appropriate file modes (r, w, a, x)
5. Check if file exists before operations
6. Use try/except for error handling
7. Consider file permissions
8. Backup important files
9. Use meaningful file names
10. Organize files in directories
""")

"""
Key Points to Remember:
1. Use open() to work with files
2. Always use 'with' statement for automatic file closing
3. File modes: 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append)
4. Handle FileNotFoundError exceptions
5. Use os.path.exists() to check if file exists
6. Files are stored permanently on disk
7. Use try/except for safe file operations
8. Consider file permissions and access rights
9. Backup important data
10. Use meaningful file names and organize files
