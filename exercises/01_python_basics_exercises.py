"""
Key Points to Remember:
1. Practice regularly - even 30 minutes a day helps
2. Don't just read the code - run it and modify it
3. Try to solve problems on your own first
4. Experiment with different approaches
5. Ask questions when you're stuck
6. Build projects to apply your knowledge
7. Practice with real-world examples
8. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're part of learning!
